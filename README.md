# Symbiote
A portable storage device for personally identifiable information (PII)

## Introduction
The modern age has created information that is inherent to a person's identity, particularly online. This info is very commonly stored on personal devices like smartphones. However, the smartphone has become a general-purpose device with many uses that are not very portable. To be more precise, The device is portable but the information is not. A special-purpose device is needed that meets the needs of a secure form of storage that can retrieve the user's identifiable info and allow it to be used in the many computer interfaces that are common today.

What if there was a device that could be plugged into any computer turning the computer into a thin client for the device? User's PII can be kept on the device and the interchange of information can be done seamlessly with the applications on the thin client. A sort of symbiote device. This is possible now with the availability of portable single-board computers with connectivity options like USB, Bluetooth, WiFi, and more.
