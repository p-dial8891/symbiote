# Symbiote
A portable storage device for personally identifiable information (PII)

## Concept
The modern age has created information that is intrinsic to a person's identity, particularly online. This info is very commonly stored on personal devices like smartphones. However, the smartphone has become a general-purpose device with many uses that are not very portable. The device is portable but the information is not. A special purpose device is needed that meets the needs of a secure storage device that can retrieve the user's identifiable info and allow it to be used in the many computer interfaces that are common today.

The cloud is the popular way to store PII however, it has become fractured with many services that don't operate well with each other. Using the cloud is a networked approach to managing data but a disconnected one can bring benefits to remote locations and air-gapped equipment requiring the highest level of security. This gives way to information being stored increasingly in edge computing devices and single board computers and other similar technology are on the rise.

What if there was device which could be plugged into any computer turning the computer into a thin client for the device. User's PII can be kept on the device and the interchange of the information can be done seamlessly with the applications on the thin client. A sort of symbiote device. This is possible now with the availability of portable single-board computers with connectivity options like USB, Bluetooth, WiFi and more.
